# 3D Super-Resolution for micro-CT (EDSR / MDSR + Deblur)

This repository provides a **true 3D super-resolution framework**
for micro-CT rock images with ×4 upscaling.

## Models
- EDSR-3D
- MDSR-3D (multi-scale)
- Deblur-aware branch for physical degradation

## Designed for
- Downstream 3-phase segmentation
- Digital rock physics
